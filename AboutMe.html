            I am a senior at the University of Oklahoma. I am majoring in MIS and will graduate in December 2019.
            One major reason I chose MIS was my interest in working with both businesses (people) and technology. I am good at solving problems and communicating with others.
            I think strategically and am very detail oriented.
            During my time at OU I have gained experience and knowledge from both my coursework and campus involvment.

            'Carpe Diem' is a phrase that I try to embrace. It means seize the day, to make the most of the present and to give little thought to the past or future. In the time that I have here, I want to love and live life to the fullest while being a positive influence
            on others. And I want a full life for everyone.
