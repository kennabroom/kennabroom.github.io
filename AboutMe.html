    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
        I am a senior at the University of Oklahoma. I am majoring in MIS and will graduate in December 2019.
        One major reason I chose MIS was my interest in working with both businesses (people) and technology. I am good at solving problems and communicating with others.
        I think strategically and am very detail oriented.
        During my time at OU I have gained experience and knowledge from both my coursework and campus involvment.
